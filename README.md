📚 Required Libraries
Install from Arduino Library Manager:

✅ ESP32 Board Package
✅ BluetoothA2DPSink
✅ ESP32 BLE Arduino
✅ TFT_eSPI (for controller)
✅ XPT2046_Touchscreen
⚙️ How It Works
Speaker boots
Plays startup sound
Starts A2DP service
Starts BLE server
Controller connects via BLE
User touches UI buttons
Commands sent via BLE
Speaker executes command
All audio streaming is handled by A2DP,

Control channel is handled by BLE.

🚀 Future Improvements (Planned)
✅ Two-way State Sync (PLAYING / PAUSED / VOL)
🔁 Auto-Reconnect BLE
🎵 AVRCP Track Info
🔋 Battery Monitoring
🌙 Sleep Mode
📡 OTA Updates
🎛 Equalizer
🐞 Known Limitations
Current BLE communication is one-way (no state feedback)
Controller uses fixed MAC address (can be improved)
No AVRCP metadata yet
